### In order for this bot to work in a Discord server, you must create a secret '.env' file. 

### This file should only contain information like this (the following code is an example):

TOKEN = ODgyOTk4NTAzPTI2ODkwNTM3.YQyBNg.vyWY47fkSo7wY97qCCRqhr_0gPA  **# in order to find your token (the long string of random characters, go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications. From here, create a bot and copy the token.**


----
### Next, you must create a Monitor through UptimeRobot. This is if you want your bot to stay active 24/7.
